# Part A
Run
- Assignment1CV.mlx to display the image used for processing
- drag the end-points of 'diameter' region props in order to measure pixel length of the object in the image
- We then divide the diameter found with the distance tool by our PPI (31.7 in my case) and that will present us with the diameter of the container in inches.

- 110.99px /31.7PPI = 3.5in

# Part C
-Run this app to show a RGB stream from the mono camera.
